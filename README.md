# BareBoard

This is a HTML 5 admin/backend/dashboard template using just Bootstrap 5. As of now there is only one template with the basic skeleton inside `basic` folder. The assets are inside `assets` folder. I am planning to keep this just as a basic template and not add other plugin/library dependencies except bootstrap.

## Roadmap

1. Add little customizations to the existing template.
2. Add pages to showcase the themed components.
3. Add more templates.

## Usage

1. Copy the `index.html` file from `basic` folder and as well as the complete `assets` folder.
2. Rename the link to `theme.css` and `bootstrap.js`
3. Rename the link to the user-avatar in `line 66` and `line 151`
4. Rename the link to the logo in `line 29` and `line 87`
5. Customize it to your needs.

> **Note:** The theme.css file contains Bootstrap 5 in a themed version that I use regularly. I found this over the internet a while ago. I have lost the link to it. Will update it if I find it.
